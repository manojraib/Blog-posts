    "A few weeks ago, I was lucky enough to present at [PyCon Australia](https://2016.pycon-au.org/), right here in my home town of Melbourne. [My talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3mwNnGu5T4) was on reproducible research, an increasingly important concept in science and data analysis as projects become more complicated and datasets become larger (see this [recent article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/26/an-alarming-number-of-scientific-papers-contain-excel-errors/), for example, on how a surprisingly high number of genetics papers contain errors because of the way Excel interprets gene names).\n",

    "I must confess that reproducibility was not a big consideration for me for most of my academic career. To be honest, when I first started doing statistical programming the basics felt so overwhelming that the idea of making it reproducible seemed beyond what I could manage! I also felt a bit overwhelmed by all of the things I seemed to need to learn once I started trying to conduct reproducible research. There just seemed to be **so much** detail on the web about Git, Github, Jupyter, etc. that I didn't really know where to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, I've realised the basics are actually very simple and only require a pretty introductory understanding of the tools you'll be using. In this post, I've tried to demystify both the process and the implementation of reproducible research, and also show you how much easier it makes your life when collaborating on projects or even coming back to your own analyses months later!"

This is a bit of a problem, because we make a heap of decisions and assumptions during data analysis that we won't remember later without writing them down. One way of documenting our decisions during our analysis is writing comments in our script (as per [this version of the life expectancy analysis](https://github.com/t-redactyl/life-expectancy-analysis/blob/master/Tidy%20script%20without%20markdown.py)). However, this is really hard to read, and therefore limits how useful its going to be later.\n",

These are browser-based documents that allow you to interactively run code as well as input text, images, tables and dynamic visualisations. The text sections are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which means you can use nice formatting features like headings, bullet points and simple tables. [Here](https://github.com/t-redactyl/life-expectancy-analysis/blob/master/Tidy%20script%20with%20literate%20programming.ipynb) is an example of the life expectancy analysis done in a Jupyter notebook, to give an example of how much clearer it makes documentation.\n",

Over the subsequent 6 months, we continually updated to new versions of these package in our global environment. This means we now have a situation where our analysis relies on different package versions to what we have currently installed, which means our scripts may produce different results or fail when we now try to run them.\n",

    "Luckily, as always, Python has an easy and elegant solution called [virtualenvs](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). The way to think of virtualenvs is that they are essentially just like your global environment, but instead of there being only one environment that affects all Python code run on your machine, you have many different, self-contained and disposable environments that are isolated from both each other and the global environment. You can see how useful virtualenvs are when you have multiple projects all needing different versions of the same packages, as changing versions of packages in the global environment is difficult.\n",

    "One of the more difficult things when completing an analysis is keeping track of what changes you've made. I've already told you that the best way of understanding what you did when you finish your analysis is leaving a tidy script, but what about all of the things you tried that didn't work and that you want to keep track of? Or the nice bits of code that you don't need for this project, but that would be useful later?\n",
    "\n",
    "One really messy and inefficient way (that I admit I am still guilty of at times!) is having multiple files with different versions of the analysis (as you saw at the start of this post). The problem with this approach is that you've got no real way of keeping track of what bits of code in the previous versions are actually useful once you're done, and let's be honest - you're probably never going to look through most of those files again.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to manage these changes more efficiently is something called [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). This means we use a system to keep track of changes and revisions to our work, while maintaining the current version as our working script. The one I use is [Git](https://git-scm.com/), which is one of the most popular, but this is by [no means the only option](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_version_control_software)! \n",
    "\n",
    "The way Git works (from my non-technical viewpoint!) is that it allows you to commit a series of snapshots of your work to a special type of folder called a local repository, or repo. This means you can keep track of changes you've made to your work (including stuff you've deleted) and even go back if you've stuffed something up (more detail [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)). You can see an example of how Git has tracked changes [here](https://github.com/t-redactyl/life-expectancy-analysis/commit/5355e90d359a62a369a84671301948749122d220), where I've added some Markdown text to the beginning of the life expectancy analysis. You can see that Git has indicated where changes were made, and also highlighted which specific parts of the text were deleted and added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other nice thing about version control is that you commit your changes with (hopefully) meaningful messages, which means that you have a record of your thinking about the project as you did it. [Here](https://github.com/t-redactyl/life-expectancy-analysis/commits/master) are the commits I did for the life expectancy analysis, to give you an idea - although you ideally should commit more frequently with more descriptive messages than I did!\n",

    "\n",
    "The website that I use to host my remote repos is called [Github](https://github.com/). Now the main function of Github is not really to give you a nice, cloud-based backup for your work, but instead is designed to help you share your projects and allow others to collaborate on them. A nice overview (involving cats!) of Github is [here](http://ericsteinborn.com/github-for-cats/#/), but in summary it allows multiple people to work on a code-based project, and keeps track of who committed what. This means that instead of you having to try and manually integrate your collaborators' contributions they are automatically merged into your project and the changes are kept track of. Most importantly, **who** made those changes is marked, meaning that if you don't understand something that a collaborator did you can work out who added the change to the project.\n",
